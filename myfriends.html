			<h1>MY FRIENDS!</h1>
			<p>These are my High School friends and my main circle of friends. We are all now on different universities; <br> Faye is studying at PLM, Arwyn chose to continue her studies at Philsca, and the last three, Lau, Say, and Gia is at UP Diliman. <br>Even tho we do not talk to each other that often, the bond that we have never dies. I am proud to have them as my friends. I still have other Best friends <br>but I will not inlcude them anymore to avoid making this long. </p>
