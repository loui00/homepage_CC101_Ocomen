			<h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
			<p>I currently reside in Navotas City which happens to also be the place where I grew up. At the age of 18, I am now currently a freshman student <br>	at San Beda University major in Computer Science. I actually did not know how I ended up taking computer science as a major, but I unexpectedly enjoy the challenge here. <br> My usual pastimes are drawing, mainly using the digital arts medium, binge watching sitcoms, and hanging out with my comfort people. <br>	I studied at my local science highscool until grade 10 and two years of senior high school in a catholic school.</p>
