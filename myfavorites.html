			<h1>MY FAVORITES!</h1>
			<p>Let me introduce to you my stress reliever and also the cause of my stress. The one that you can see in the background is <br>Riri and she is the youngest member of our family. We also have Arya which is 3 years older than Riri. <br>I cannot find a decent picture of the both of them because most of their pics together are so chaotic. <br>They are Bichon Frise which is a sweet and clingy dog breed. Both of them are like a sibling to me and <br>I am usually the one to take care of them. I will forever love my dogs.</p>
